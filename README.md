# Circus of Plates â€“ Game

## Description

Circus of Plates is a single-player game featuring a clown (Mario character) who juggles two stacks of plates (Mushrooms). Colored mushrooms fall in queues, and the player's goal is to catch three consecutive mushrooms of the same color to make them vanish and increase their score.

### Falling Objects
- There are 3 kinds of falling objects: mushrooms, villains, and coins.
- The user earns points for collecting three consecutive mushrooms of the same color.
- Collecting falling coins also rewards the player with number of points.
- Touching falling villains results in a point deduction, with the penalty varying based on the type of villain.

### Difficulty Levels
- The game offers 3 levels of difficulty, each with differences in speed, the number of falling objects, and their types.

### Engine
- The game utilizes an engine (.jar) supporting three types of objects: movable, constant, and user-controlled objects (found in the "lib" directory).

1. Singleton
2. Factory Method
3. Iterator
